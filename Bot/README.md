GENERAL DIRECTIONS:

   


To Run the Program:

1. Download all files and put them in a directory.
2. Run the makefile.
3. Change VPATH to the path you installed the files in.
   If you have g++ added to the environment path then you can delete
   PROJECTPATH.
4. Change CXX to "g++" from "wine g++" if on a Windows system. 
   Make sure that the wine path variable (for Linux) or Windows path variable 
   (for Windows) is set to the directory where g++ resides.
5. Open hBot.exe.
6. Open hearthstone.exe.
7. Select inject option to inject the dll into Hearthstone process.
